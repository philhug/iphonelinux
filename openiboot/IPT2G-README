iPod Touch 2G Users:

Please note, this software is extremely alpha and currently only makes the device reboot from C code. This is not a bug, it's a feature. :)

Also, for those interested in helping out, here's a TODO for what's remaining:

 * Reverse and Verify the information in includes/hardware/clock1.h is correct.. Then we'll have interrupts and USB :D
 * Port GPIO driver
 * Verify SPI and NOR work.. They're the same as the iphone2g, so they should.. but just verify it :)
 * Port LCD Driver (I'll probably have to do this one.. I have some good info already)
 * Verify the DMA driver works (again.. it's the same as the iphone2g)
 * Port the rest - at least we'll have the basic openiboot working by this point :D
